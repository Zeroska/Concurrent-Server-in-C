This is why I use select over the fork thing because fork need to wait for the terminated signal from kernel 
And it might leave the zombie process and thing will get litter messier with the SIGCLHD and I don't wanna to 
install the damn Singal hanlder for that, select and all the FD set is good for me I guess
